## Multiplayer Todo

* Fix bug where positions from previous round are rendered
* Fix bug where direction seems to freeze. Should always default to Straight
* Predictively render Player
* Render Opponents at a 100ms delay to smoothen movements
* Introduce Game instances to server to handle multiple ongoing games
* Start a Game after 6 Players have joined OR 2+ Players have joined AND it 
has passed 30 seconds since the 2nd Player joined. Whichever comes first.
* Private Games with secret code or URL
* Optimise server to client data traffic.
