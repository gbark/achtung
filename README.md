## Multiplayer Todo

* [x] Build authoritative game server using Node/SocketIO/Immutable/Redux
* [x] Stream client keyboard input to server for processing
* [x] Render own player on client
* [x] Predictively render opponents on client using *dead reckoning*. Reconcile with actual positions when they arrive from the server.
* [ ] Push holes in snake from server to client
* [ ] Introduce game instances to server to handle multiple ongoing games
* [ ] Start a game after 6 players have joined OR 2+ players have joined AND it has passed 25 seconds since the 2nd player joined. Whichever comes first.
* [ ] Private games with secret code or URL
* [ ] Optimise server to client data traffic. 
	- [x] Send only new positions since last serverUpdate
	- [ ] Only send game.gamearea if it has changed
	- [x] Dont send game.mode
	- [x] Dont send game.player.leftKey
	- [x] Dont send game.player.rightKey
	- [x] Dont send game.player.keyDesc
	- [x] Dont send game.player.direction
	- [ ] Only send game.player.angle if it has changed
	- [ ] Only send game.player.alive if it has changed
	- [ ] Only send game.player.score if it has changed
	- [ ] Only send game.player.color if it has changed

## Bugs

* [x] First X no of positions are some times not rendered on client
* [ ] Client doesnt clean up fake positions
* [ ] Client some times predictively render a position after round is over
* [ ] Client some times doesnt render the last real position
* [ ] Client prediction is not very accurate. Off by ~0.5 points compared to server for a player moving straight.
